# Hotel Stay Site

Hotel Stay Site is a high-quality web application that enables users to book hotels or homestays for their stay, no matter where they go. With the ability to view, book, and even list properties for booking, Hotel Stay Site offers a complete package for travelers. The application is built on the powerful ReactJS javascript library, which enables us to create high-performance web pages that are both efficient and effective.

The application is a full-stack solution that employs MongoDB for database management and NodeJS and ExpressJS for creating servers and implementing backend tasks. The site offers user authentication, allowing users to register or login to the application, ensuring that their data remains secure.

To create and manage different routes for the application, React Routes and React Router Dom have been utilized, making the application a single-page application. Additionally, we have used TailwindCSS to style the React components, making the rendering of the components more effective.

We believe that Hotel Stay Site is a valuable tool for anyone who is looking for a place to stay while traveling. It is fast, easy to use, and secure, providing users with a seamless experience. With a focus on user experience and functionality, Hotel Stay Site is the perfect choice for those seeking a reliable booking platform.
